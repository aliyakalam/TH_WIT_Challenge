    <h3>Vision and Mission</h3>
    <p> My mission is to explore and strengthen the understanding of the fundamental concepts of Python through
        practical application of theoretical concepts. I believe the same applies to other fields of study as well and
        the skills that we learn by doing the projects make us better prepared for the industry.</p>
